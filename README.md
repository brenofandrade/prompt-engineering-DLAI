# AI Applications Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for studying and experimenting with AI applications. It includes implementations of machine learning models, deep learning techniques, and data-driven solutions for various use cases. The goal is to explore, test, and document different AI methodologies, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Topics covered include:

* Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
* Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
* NLP (Natural Language Processing)
* Computer Vision
* Time Series Forecasting
* Reinforcement Learning
* Data Engineering for AI

Each notebook is structured with explanations, code, and visualizations to facilitate understanding. Feel free to explore and contribute! ðŸš€

First of all, create a API KEY for use the service of your favourite provider and store it safely in your config file. 

In my case I use the OpenAI API.

Let's have FUN!
